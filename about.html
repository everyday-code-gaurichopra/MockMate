                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>MockMate was born from a simple observation: while there are countless resources to find job openings, there's a significant gap in effective, personalized tools for interview practice. Traditional methods like reading articles or practicing in front of a mirror lack the dynamic feedback necessary for real improvement. We wanted to change that.</p>
                <p>As students of engineering and technology, we saw an opportunity to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to create a more realistic and beneficial practice environment. We envisioned a platform that could not only ask relevant questions but also provide immediate, constructive criticismâ€”acting as a personal interview coach available 24/7.</p>
                
                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>MockMate simulates real-world job interviews by using cutting-edge AI to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generate questions tailored to specific job roles and experience levels.</li>
                        <li>Listen to your answers and provide a real-time transcript.</li>
                        <li>Analyze your responses and offer instant feedback on clarity, structure, and content.</li>
                        <li>Provide high-quality example answers to help you understand best practices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Our goal is to help you walk into your next interview feeling prepared, confident, and ready to make a great impression.</p>

                <h2>The Team</h2>
                <p>We are a team of passionate students from Chitkara University, dedicated to using technology to solve real-world problems. This project is a culmination of our studies in front-end development, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.</p>
